        "\n",
        "The median is the middle value in a dataset when the data points are arranged in ascending (or descending) order. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",

        "Answer: Dispersion refers to the extent to which data points in a dataset differ from the central value (mean, median, or mode) and from each other. It gives us an idea of the \"spread\" or variability within the dataset. A measure of dispersion helps us understand how concentrated or spread out the data points are. The more dispersed the data, the more variability there is in the dataset. Conversely, low dispersion means that the data points are closely clustered around the central value.\n",

        "Answer: A box plot (also known as a box-and-whisker plot) is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset, which shows the spread, central tendency, and skewness of the data. It is particularly useful for identifying the range, median, interquartile range, and outliers in a dataset. Box plots provide a concise summary of a dataset's distribution and help compare distributions across different groups or datasets.\n",

        "Q1: The first quartile, or 25th percentile, is the median of the lower half of the dataset. It marks the point below which 25% of the data falls.\n",

        "The box shows the middle 50% of the data, i.e., the IQR (IQR = Q3 - Q1).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Median (Q2): The line inside the box represents the median (or the second quartile), which divides the dataset into two equal halves. This is the middle value when the data is ordered.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Whiskers: The lines extending from both sides of the box, known as the whiskers, represent the range of the data within a certain threshold.\n",

        "4.Outliers: Data points that fall outside the range defined by the whiskers are considered outliers. These are typically plotted as individual points or circles above or below the whiskers.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Box Plot Variations: Some box plots also use notches (in the box) to show the confidence interval around the median. Additionally, some box plots may show mean markers (dots or asterisks) along with the median.\n",

In a perfectly symmetric distribution, like the normal distribution, the data is evenly distributed on both sides of the mean.

        "A Poisson process is a statistical model used to describe events that occur randomly and independently over a fixed interval of time or space, with a constant average rate. The Poisson process is often used in scenarios where events are rare or occur infrequently but independently of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Poisson distribution is used to model the probability of a given number of events happening in a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Characteristics of a Poisson Process:\n",
        "\n",
        "Events are independent: The occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of another.\n",
        "\n",
        "Constant average rate: The events occur at a constant average rate, denoted as λ (lambda), which represents the expected number of events per unit of time or space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rare events: The events are typically rare within the chosen time or space interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "Real-Life Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Example Scenario: Customer Arrivals at a Coffee Shop:\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say that, on average, 5 customers arrive at a coffee shop every hour. We can model this situation using a Poisson process where:\n",
        "\n",
        "The average rate (λ) of customer arrivals is 5 customers per hour.\n",
        "We are interested in finding the probability of exactly 3 customers arriving in an hour."

        "Answer: What is a Random Variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "A random variable is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon or experiment. It is a function that assigns a real number to each outcome in a sample space. The value of a random variable is uncertain and depends on the outcome of a random event or process. Random variables are essential in probability theory and statistics because they help quantify the uncertainty of random events.\n",
        "\n",
        "Discrete Random Variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "A discrete random variable is a random variable that can take on a finite or countable number of distinct values. These values are typically integers or whole numbers. In other words, there is a clear, separable gap between possible values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features of Discrete Random Variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "Finite or countably infinite number of values: The set of possible values is countable, meaning you can list them (even if the list is infinitely long, like the set of all positive integers).\n",
        "\n",
        "Specific outcomes: Each outcome is a distinct number, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of discrete random variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of heads in 10 coin flips (it can range from 0 to 10).\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of customers arriving at a store in a day.\n",
